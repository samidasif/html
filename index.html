 <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about 
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies 
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all 
    the other scientific journals her work had 
    appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On 
    The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book 
    since college, and the longer she spent in these 
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be 
    free.</p>
  <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, 
    sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote 
    proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of 
    people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although 
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling 
    the secrets of the llama <abbr 
    title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an 
    outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think 
    she had something better to do.</p>
